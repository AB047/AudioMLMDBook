## What is an audio made of?

### INTRODUCTION 

+ Audio signal is an electrical signal that represents a sound.
+ Sound is a variation in the instantaneous air pressure .The variations are of  air pressure above and below average (barometric) air pressure.
+  Audio is  an electrical (usually voltage) waveform that is analogous to the sound pressure waveform.
+  Audio signals are synthesized by a transducer such as a microphone which converts the sound pressure variations into voltage variations.
+  A higher voltage represents a higher pressure, and a lower voltage represents a lower pressure.
+ The audio signal is usually of  two types  
        *  Analog audio
        *  Digital audio
+ Analog audio are sampled and encoded into digital audio. Digital signal are represented as  a series of binary numbers.

+ In a digital system, an **ADC** converts physical sound to a digital signal using pulse code modulation/ any other encoding standard.
+ **DAC** will convert digital audio signal back to physical audio through an amplifier and speaker.
+ Components of a digital audio system include:
    1. Compression
    2. Storage 
    3. Processing
      4. Transmission
